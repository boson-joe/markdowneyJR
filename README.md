Hi!

My name is Markdowney Jr, nice to meet you! I am a Vim plugin that makes editing [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files easy using simple keystrokes. Depending on the formatting option, I can do transformations on visual selection, line range or motion (like `3wd`, for example) or combinations of those. Hit a keystroke once - and transformation is made. If you then hit the same keystroke once or multiple times again, I will toggle through options for a particular transformation and change the text accordingly. For example, if you select a word and hit a keystroke responsible for emphasis multiple times, I  will make selected text cursive, bold and then both, and once again, toggling between the options. Please refer to the [User Guide](https://github.com/boson-joe/markdowneyJR/wiki/MarkdowneyJr-User-Guide) to see how we can interact.

There is no need to set remaps for all the formatting options - you can define just two remaps in your `vimrc`, and I will take care of the rest. In case you don't want to set any remaps at all, I can give you default ones. You can also remap any or all formatting options to your liking. To see how you can set remaps and customize your experience please refer to the [Customization Guide](https://github.com/boson-joe/markdowneyJR/wiki/MarkdowneyJr-Customization-Guide).

At the moment I can handle basic [basic markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for you, but if you [write my devs](https://github.com/boson-joe/markdowneyJR/wiki/MarkdowneyJr-contacts), they would be happy to introduce more features.
