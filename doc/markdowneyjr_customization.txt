Links contents                                                       *MDJLinks*

When the plugin transforms text into markdown links, it uses functions to 
determine which path to prepend to the resulting filename. By default, 
the plugin sets it to the directory of the file being edited for regular links, 
and '/Img' directory in the directory of the file being edited for image links. 
You can either turn it off if you don't want to bother with defining your own 
functions (there will be just an empty space in a place where the path goes), 
or, well, define your own functions.

To make the plugin put nothing in place where path goes, you need to define one 
or both of the following variables in your vimrc:

    g:MARKDOWNEYJR_no_URL - for regular links,
    g:MARKDOWNEYJR_no_IMG_link - for image links.

You can initialize it to anything.

To actually change the contents of the path, you need to do two things:

1) Define functions that would return a string that is the path to the file. 
Don't let it include the file name itself, unless that is what you want it. 
For example, you can do write something like that in you vimrc:

       function! MARKDOWNEYJRDeterminePathForALink()
           return expand("%:p:h")
       endfunction

This will return a path to a directory of a file being edited.

2) After functions are defined, you need to set a couple of global variables 
to let the plugin know that you want to use your own custom functions. 
The variables are:

    g:MARKDOWNEYJR_GetPathForUrl - for regular links,
    g:MARKDOWNEYJR_GetPathForImg - for image links.

You need to initialize them with :h Funcref to your custom functions. You could 
write something like that in your vimrc:

    let g:MARKDOWNEYJR_GetPathForUrl = 
                              function("MARKDOWNEYJRDeterminePathForALink")

After that you will have all regular links in a form that you want. 
Repeat the same for image links, if you'd like to.

Please refer to the relevant sections of the |MDJUserGuide| to see how you 
could interact with the plugin and how to set remaps to your liking.
